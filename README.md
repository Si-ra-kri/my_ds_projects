# 🧠 My Data Science Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of data science and machine learning projects. This repository serves as a portfolio of self-contained, hands-on projects I've built to deepen my understanding of ML concepts, data processing, and model deployment.

Each project is organized in its own folder and typically includes:

- 📁 Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts
- 📊 Data preprocessing and visualization
- 📈 Model training and evaluation
- 📝 Individual README files with details and insights

## 💡 What's Inside

You’ll find a mix of beginner to intermediate projects covering:

- Supervised Learning (Classification & Regression)
- Data Visualization
- Feature Engineering & Data Cleaning
- Model Evaluation and Interpretation
- Real-world datasets from platforms like Kaggle, UCI, or open APIs

Projects are titled and structured to be understandable and reproducible by others.
