## 📦 Requirements

Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🛠️ How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_ds_projects.git
cd my_ds_projects/Human\ Action\ Detection/
```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Human Action Detection.ipynb"
```
3. Run all the cells in order to:

   Load and explore the dataset

   Visualize class distributions

   Preprocess data (e.g., label encoding, resampling, scaling)

   Train a classification model

   Evaluate the model with accuracy and confusion matrix

   View key insights from model coefficients

## 🧠 Model Summary
Model Used: Losistic Regression

Preprocessing:

Label encoding for categorical variables

Scaling using StandardScaler and RobustScaler

Resampling to balance class distribution

Train/Test Split: 80/20

Metrics Used: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Key Insights
Actions with distinct motion patterns are more separable.

Feature importance from model coefficients shows which signals impact classification.

Resampling significantly improved class balance and model performance.
