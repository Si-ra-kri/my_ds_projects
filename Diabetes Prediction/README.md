## 📁 Projects Included

### 🔹 1. Diabetes Prediction (Notebook)
**Path**: `Diabetes Prediction/Diabetes Prediction`  
This is an interactive **Jupyter Notebook**-based project that performs exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. It is ideal for learning, visualization, and sharing insights.

**Features:**
- Step-by-step code with Markdown explanations
- Visual data exploration (e.g., distributions, heatmaps)
- Model training and evaluation using classification or regression
- Designed for learning and demonstration

### 🔹 2. Simple Diabetes Regression (Script)
**Path**: `Diabetes Prediction/Simple Diabetes Regression`  
This project uses the built-in **`sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes()`** and trains a **Linear Regression** model. It is implemented as a pure Python script and demonstrates quick modeling and evaluation.

**Features:**
- Clean script with no notebook interface
- Uses 10 clinical features to predict disease progression
- Evaluates using RMSE and R² Score
- Generates scatter plot for actual vs predicted values
